这个项目是关于通过小米手机日志去分析这部手机的电池容量。现在我只在国行版的小米14上抓取日志（因为目前我只在使用小米14）。它是我在2024年10月9日想出来的，过几天后我付诸了行动。
尽管现在有很多人已经做了和我这个项目相关的产品，但我还是希望自己开发一个能够分析小米手机日志的工具。
我觉得这会是我人生中最宝贵的经验，因为我可以在这里取得进步，同时还可能顺带提升一下我的英语水平。
我非常清楚地认识到我做的很多事情都需要提升。欢迎大家对我的项目提供帮助，指出其中的一些不足之处。
我的主专业并非与计算机相关，由于学业原因，这个项目不定期更新，但我会一直加油的！

This program is about analyzing battery capacity on logs from Xiaomi smart phones.
It was considered in 09/10/2024 and was established a few days later.
I am solely using Xiaomi 14 with mainland China version of Xiaomi HyperOS installed to capture logs at present because I only use Xiaomi 14 now in my daily life.
I am willing to develop a tool which can analysis some practical infomation from logs of Xiaomi Smart Phones by myself despite others have already coined the same programs.
By creating this, I believe that it will be a valuable experience for me to acquire knowledge about how to develop an useful product and make progress from other engineers.
In addition to this purpose I mentioned before, I am able to practise my English skill in this programming platform.
Nevertheless, I am clearly realized that all of this is still imperfect, so I consider that it is a good start.
At the same time, I friendly welcome everyone to point out shortcomings and provide suggestions of my project.
My major is not related to computing. Therefore,due to academic reasons, this project is not updated regularly. But I will keep working hard!
